# h2spec

h2spec is a conformance testing tool for HTTP/2 implementation.  
This tool is compliant with [RFC 7540 (HTTP/2)](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540.txt) and [RFC 7541 (HPACK)](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7541.txt).

## Install

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/summerwind/h2spec/releases), find the version you want, and download the zip file or tarball file. The docker image is also available in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/summerwind/h2spec/).

## Your server

Your server should respond on `GET /` or `POST /` requests with status 200 response with non-empty data.

```

### Running a specific test case

You can choose a test case to run by specifying the *Spec ID* as the command argument. For example, if you want to run test cases for HTTP/2, run h2spec as following:

```
$ h2spec http2
```

If you add a section number after the *Spec ID*, test cases related to a specific section will be run. For example, if you want to run test cases related to 6.3 of HTTP/2, run h2spec as following:

```
$ h2spec http2/6.3
```

If you add a test number after the section number, you can run the specific test case individually. For example, to run only the first test case related to 6.3 of HTTP/2 6.3, run h2spec as following:

```
$ h2spec http2/6.3/1
```

The *Spec ID* can be specified multiple times.

```
$ h2spec http2/6.3 generic
```

Currently supported *Spec IDs* are as follows. `generic` is the original spec of h2spec, includes generic test cases for HTTP/2 servers.

Spec ID | Description
--- | ---
http2 | Test cases for RFC 7540 (HTTP/2)
hpack | Test cases for RFC 7541 (HPACK)
generic | Generic test cases for HTTP/2 servers

### Dryrun Mode

To display the list of test cases to be run, use *Dryrun Mode* as follows:

```
$ h2spec --dryrun
```

### Strict Mode

When *Strict Mode* is enabled, h2spec will run the test cases related to the contents requested with the `SHOULD` notation in each specification. It is useful for more rigorous verification of HTTP/2 implementation.

```
$ h2spec --strict
```

### Disable Certain Tests
If you use `h2spec` as a part of your CI/CD pipeline, you may find it useful to be able to manually exclude specific tests by their *Spec ID*s before the corresponding issue gets resolved:
```
$ h2spec --exclude hpack/2 --exclude hpack/4/1
```

### Exit On External Failure
There are cases when you'd want `h2pec` to stop performing tests due to some external event happened. Usually that would be a message in some log file:

```
h2spec --exit-on-external-failure --external-failure-regexp "regexp that matches your error message" --external-failure-source /tmp/some_log_file
```
